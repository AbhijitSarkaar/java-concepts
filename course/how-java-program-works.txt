    - 1 file contains 1 public class
    - filename should be same as class name 

- JVM
    - jvm can be used to run bytecodes

    - jvms are platform dependent. jvm implementations depend on platforms that tuns jvm e.g linux, mac 
    - jvm has jit compiler ( just in time )

- JRE
    - jvm with class libraries
    - jvm uses class libraries for getting source code for classes to convert into bytecodes
    - jre can only consume java programs. it can not compile. it can run java programs 

- JDK
    - to write and compile java programs, jdk is needed 
    - java compiler understands java syntax and creates bytecodes by compiling java programs
    - jdk 21 version is installed to run java from oracle website in form of dmg
    - java is installed using jdk ( java development kit )

- JVM, JRE, JDK are platform dependent. java program and bytecode is platform independent
