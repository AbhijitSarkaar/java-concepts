- abstraction is about hiding implementation details of a class and only exposing relevant information 
- 'abstract' keyword is used to define abstract class and methods 
- abstract classes can be extended by other normal and abstract classes 
- implementations of abstract methods are done in sub classes extended from abstract class 
- abstract classes may have constructor and the constructor can only be called by java during instantiation 
of child classes 

//example 

// GraphicObject.java
package abstraction;

public abstract class GraphicObject {
	abstract void draw();
}

// Circle.java
package abstraction;

public class Circle extends GraphicObject {
	public void draw() {
		System.out.println("Circle draw");
	}
}

// Main.java
package abstraction;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		GraphicObject c = new Circle();
		c.draw();
	}
}
